poc repo how can I convert my [game-of-function](https://github.com/Pengeszikra/game-of-function) from react / [react-state-factory](https://github.com/Pengeszikra/react-state-function) / saga implementation to qwik ⚡️

create new qwik project is so simple
```shell
pnpm create qwick@lates
```

add tailwind - or - any another package which one is need a little basic config is also easy
```shell
pnpm qwik add tailwind
```

## Why qwik ?
Because qwik have awesome hydration philosophy, and give a different state handling than react have, and I know that way very well, so I like to try the `Signals`.
> bonus: in JSX part qwik use `class` instead `className` God bless the creators!
